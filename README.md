# Shopping App
This represents an online shopping system. Think the ecommerce parts of shopify.

The concept was that you'd have a static frontend that would be spat out by the
backend tooling, to ensure absolute speed/scalability for the shopping
experience. 

Some parts would remain dynamic:
  Add to cart: A combination of Javascript actions and then a number of
  Checkout: Standard rails routes for checkout.

This was used successfully in a live ecommerce store but ultimately I 
didn't forge forward with the project, mostly for personal reasons.

Hopefully this can be helpful for others as code to learn from.

# Before I forget...
Some of the code here, you can easily tell which bits, was hasilty added in
without much thought for the quality control I normally exercise on my code
bases.  

Why you might ask... when your wife tells you she wants to launch her ecommerce
business on date X and has already patiently waited for a while you make it
happen :).

# License
GNU 3 as I don't want this code sailing off into the hands of some corporate
who profits off it. I am releasing it for the learning value for others.

That said if you want to acquire a non GNU 3 license from me for some purpose
please get in touch.
